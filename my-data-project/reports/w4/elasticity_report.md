## Summary Statistics

- **Number of segments analyzed**: 1
- **Mean elasticity**: -0.089
- **Median elasticity**: -0.089
- **Standard deviation**: nan

## Key Findings

### Overall Price Sensitivity

**Overall Elasticity**: -0.089 (SE: 0.073)

This indicates that a 1% increase in price leads to approximately a 8.9% decrease in quantity demanded.

## Methodology

- **Model**: Panel regression with entity and time fixed effects
- **Standard Errors**: Clustered at entity level
- **Log-log specification**: Elasticity = d(ln(quantity))/d(ln(price))
